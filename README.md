## Environment maker
I made this so that I can easily transfer from one workspace to another easily, by having a collection of package and extension downloading scripts


It will also be a good way to learn how to easily image computers to be set up and ready for certain tasks with just a single script, rather than having to go into it manually or with a GUI (ew)
